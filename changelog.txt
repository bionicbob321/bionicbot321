UPDATE 1.5.0 (09/06/2021):
- Fixed a bug with the "calculate" command that caused any multiplication
  to equal "NaN". Turns out I suck at spotting typos.
- Any user can delete a recent message from the bot by reacting to the 
  message with the :wastebasket: emoji. Only works on messages recently
  sent by the bot. Older messages must still be cleared by a moderator
- Removed the "annoy#" command. Will be readded when I find a way to
  stop abuse.
- Deprecated the "sum" command. This is now covered by the "calculate" command
- Deprecated the "annoyme" command. This is now covered by the "annoy" command
